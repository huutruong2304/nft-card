## Note:

What have you done so far?

- Web's UI can be responsive
- Display NFT card list
- Search, filter and sort by name, price, tier, time
- Load more data
- After 60s, data will be refresh

What are some improvement/ missing pieces you would like to do if you have more time?

- UX and UI are still not good (for instance: when fetching new data, the page is scrolled to top)
- Data may be is loaded all, I want to handle to it can be keep previous data before displaying new data
- Missing details page
